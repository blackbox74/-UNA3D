# -UNA3D
Una3D is a printer 3D, the start external measurements will be 300x300x300,  and the printer area will be 200x200x200.
We have tried, where it was possible to to simplify the mechanics and electronics, so we can install and setup the 3DPR in just one day.

The development of UNA3D is based on the idea of being able to put a printer in every school, in every craft workshop, in every workshop
We have experience in the field of mechanics and electronics thanks to constant participation to FABLABNAPLES, and we want to capitalize on our knowledge so that you can get a product open to everyone, simple, but scalable and editable.
